        THIS IS NEW FUTURISM.

    <p>
      This is new futurism, built by those you scorned, built on the 
      foundations of what you wanted to destroy. This is futurism built 
      on reformation, not destruction.

        THIS IS FUTURISM THAT WILL HAVE A FUTURE 
        FOR EVERYONE, BUILT BY EVERYONE.

    <p> 
      We aim to change current attitudes about the future and technology; we want to encourage 
      the use of technology as a means to build and connect, not to destroy and divide. We want 
      to move forward from the past without feeling the need to demolish it; we intend to use the 
      past as a reference for building the future. We wish to create systems that are flexible; 
      to avoid chaos, time and progress lost during destruction. We want technology, and the 
      future as a whole, to be accessible for everyone; we want to reform outdated methods of 
      communication and sharing.

          WE BELIEVE FUTURISM IS ABOUT PROGRESS, PROGRESS THAT CANNOT OCCUR WITHOUT EVERYONE.

    <p>
      This is new futurism, built by your successors. This is futurism, presented on the technology 
      that you praised, technology you donâ€™t understand. This is futurism, your obsolescence.
