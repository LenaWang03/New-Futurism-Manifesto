      <p>
        This is new futurism, built by those you scorned, built on the
        foundations of what you wanted to destroy. This is futurism built on
        reformation, not destruction.
      </p>
      <gradientFont>
        <small>
          THIS IS FUTURISM THAT WILL HAVE A FUTURE FOR EVERYONE, BUILT BY
          EVERYONE.

      <p>
        We aim to change current attitudes about the future and technology; we
        want to encourage the use of technology as a means to build and connect,
        not to destroy and divide. We want to move forward from the past without
        feeling the need to demolish it; we intend to use the past as a
        reference for building the future. We wish to create systems that are
        flexible; to avoid chaos, time and progress lost during destruction. We
        want technology, and the future as a whole, to be accessible for
        everyone; we want to reform outdated methods of communication and
        sharing.
      </p>

      <gradientFont>
        <small>
          WE BELIEVE FUTURISM IS ABOUT PROGRESS, PROGRESS THAT CANNOT OCCUR
          WITHOUT EVERYONE.
        </small>

      <p>
        This is new futurism, built by your successors. This is futurism,
        presented on the technology that you praised, technology you donâ€™t
        understand. This is futurism, your obsolescence.
      </p>
