        This is new futurism, built by those you scorned, built on the
        foundations of what you wanted to destroy. This is futurism built on
        reformation, not destruction.

          THIS IS FUTURISM THAT WILL HAVE A FUTURE FOR EVERYONE, BUILT BY

      <p>
        We aim to change current attitudes about the future and technology; we
        want to encourage the use of technology as a means to build and connect,
        not to destroy and divide. We want to move forward from the past without
        feeling the need to demolish it; we intend to use the past as a
        reference for building the future. We wish to create systems that are
        flexible; to avoid chaos, time and progress lost during destruction. We
        want technology, and the future as a whole, to be accessible for
        everyone; we want to reform outdated methods of communication and
        sharing.

      <gradientFont>
        <small>
          WE BELIEVE FUTURISM IS ABOUT PROGRESS, PROGRESS THAT CANNOT OCCUR
          WITHOUT EVERYONE.

      <p>
        This is new futurism, built by your successors. This is futurism,
        presented on the technology that you praised, technology you don’t
        understand. This is futurism, your obsolescence.

          We do not need to destroy elements of the past to move forward. Progress

          there can be no present, and no future at all.
